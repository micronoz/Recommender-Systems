# Recommender-Systems
## Description
This project contains multiple sub-projects that involve the use of various recommender systems methods to carry out tasks like recommending, prediction and network analysis.

## Project 1
This sub-project's task is to create a pipeline for predicting beer ratings based on different models that take into account, text-based reviews about the beer, alcohol content of the beer or category. The second part of the project aims to classify distinguish beer categories using a classifier.

## Project 2
In the first part of this sub-project I did a similar task as Project 1 where I used classifiers to distinguish beer categories. In addition to the classification I utilized various performance analysis metrics to fine-tune the model and used a precision/recall curve to examine the errors of the classifier. In the second part I carried out analysis of a Facebook ego-network dataset, and using the graph I utilized various network analysis and community detection techniques (Modularity, Normalized cut cost) to get an insight into the Facebook network.

## Project 3
This sub-project aims to solve two problems defined by an in-class Kaggle competition. First part of the project uses an Amazon customer shopping dataset to recommend new items to customers who would be interested in buying them. Second part of the project again uses the same dataset from Amazon but this part analyzes the list of items along with their descriptions, reviews, and indicated categories to predict the category of an unseen item.

## Project 4
This sub-project is an implementation of text sentiment analysis and tests various models of analyzing text to make predictions about the rating a user might have given after writing the text review. The best perfoming models was the predictor trained on the counts of unique unigrams in the training set without removing the punctuation, showing us that punctuation is an indicator of the attitude of text.
